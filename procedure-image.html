            <div class="procedure">
                <h4>Preliminary Inspection</h4>
                <p>Steering and vibration problems are not always the result of improper alignment. They may also be caused by wheel and tire imbalance or other factors. To ensure proper alignment readings, the following inspections should be done and corrections made before inspecting caster, camber or toe, see Figure 01:</p>
                <p>Camber is the angle of the wheel, measured in degrees, when viewed from the front of the vehicle. If the top of the wheel is leaning out from the center of the car, then the camber is positive ,if it's leaning in, then the camber is negative. If the camber is out of adjustment, it will cause tire wear on one side of the tire's tread. If the camber is too far negative, for instance, then the tire will wear on the inside of the tread.</p>
                <p>When you turn the steering wheel, the front wheels respond by turning on a pivot attached to the suspension system. Caster is the angle of this steering pivot, measured in degrees, when viewed from the side of the vehicle. If the top of the pivot is leaning toward the rear of the car, then the caster is positive, if it is leaning toward the front, it is negative. If the caster is out of adjustment, it can cause problems in straight line tracking. If the caster is different from side to side, the vehicle will pull to the side with the less positive caster. If the caster is equal but too negative, the steering will be light and the vehicle will wander and be difficult to keep in a straight line. If the caster is equal but too positive, the steering will be heavy and the steering wheel may kick when you hit a bump. Caster has little affect on tire wear.</p>
                <p>The best way to visualize caster is to picture a shopping cart caster. The pivot of this type of caster, while not at an angle, intersects the ground ahead of the wheel contact patch. When the wheel is behind the pivot at the point where it contacts the ground, it is in positive caster. Picture yourself trying to push the cart and keep the wheel ahead of the pivot. The wheel will continually try to turn from straight ahead. That is what happens when a car has the caster set too far negative. Like camber, on many front-wheel-drive vehicles, caster is not adjustable. If the caster is out on these cars, it indicates that something is worn or bent, possibly from an accident, and must be repaired or replaced.

                <ol>
                    <li>Inspect tires for proper inflation pressures and even tread wear.</li>
                    <li>Inspect wheel bearings for looseness.</li>
                    <li>Inspect ball joints and tie rod ends for excessive looseness.</li> 
                    <li>Also check steering gear operation and mounting.</li>       	
                    <li>Inspect operation of struts.</li>

                <h4>Camber</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Inspect for worn suspension components.</li>
                    <li>Inspect standing curb height</li>
                    <li>Remove heavy weights from trunk.</li> 
                    <li>Inspect wheel bearings for excessive freeplay.</li>       	
                    <li>Always road test vehicle after adjusting alignment, noting the following:</li>
                    <ol>
                    	<li>If vehicle still pulls, switch front tires.</li>
                        <li>If vehicle pulls in same direction, inspect alignment and rear tracking.</li>
                        <li>If vehicle pulls in opposite direction, rotate tires and road test</li>
                    </ol>
